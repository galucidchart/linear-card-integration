/**
 * Semantic Fields serve as standardized categories that transcend individual data source labels, facilitating
 * a uniform way to access and manipulate data. For instance, regardless of the source, data that pertains to "titles"
 * or "user information" often carries the same kind of information, though it may be labeled differently across systems.
 * Lucid’s Semantic Fields ensure that such data is recognized and treated consistently within the platform,
 * regardless of external labeling conventions.
 *
 * Semantic Mapping is the process through which Lucid aligns these disparate field names to a set of standardized
 * Semantic Fields. By using Semantic Fields like Title, Description, User, and Project, Lucid simplifies the way
 * users access and interact with data brought in from external sources.
 *
 * Benefits of Semantic Fields:
 * Uniformity: Ensures that data from diverse sources is referenced consistently within Lucid.
 * Integration Simplicity: Simplifies the process of integrating new data sources into Lucid by mapping to an established set of Semantic Fields.
 * Feature Compatibility: Allows for seamless use of Lucid’s intelligent features across all data, regardless of its origin.
 * Data Organization: Provides a structured approach to organizing and grouping data within the Lucid ecosystem.
